<h3>About the Project</h3>
It is the Block Chain based solution for maintaining a record of marks obtain by each student. On the Front end it has a exam module. using this module Professor can create a set of test and give its access to student. The student can anonymously ( using the public address ) give the exam. Based on the scored received the application will transfer the appropriate amount of coins (here I am using Komoda block chain as a ledger to store transaction on public domain)
